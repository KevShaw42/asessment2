    <h1>Rules of Rock, Paper, &amp;Scissors</h1>
    <h2>
        <b>Objective</b>
    </h2>
    <p>Rock, Paper, &amp;Scissors is a two-player game that involves 3 possible "weapon" choices in order to defeat your opponent.
        Both players simultaneously pick a weapon to play against their opponent. Each choice has a strength and weakness
        to clearly define if it wins or loses based upon the opposite choice. If both opponents play the same weapon at the
        time, it is consisded a wash, and is repeated until a winner emerges.</p>
